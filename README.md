# Geospatial-Crop-Yield-Forecasting-Enhancing-Accuracy-with-DNN-and-XGBoost

Agricultural management is significant in a populous country like India. Farmers must have advance knowledge about predicted crop production and crop condition within particular area in order to make economic and farming decisions. To generate the yield, we consider the factors like temperature, humidity, pressure, NDVI values, Latitude, Longitude etc. When cultivating a particular kind of crop on a specific type of soil, there are a number of factors to be considered. A crop recommender system considers soil properties such as N, P, and K, as well as other factors like rainfall, humidity, and pH levels, to choose the best crop for the farm. A recommendation system was built using machine learning algorithm like XGBoost to recommend the suitable crop. A user interface named CROPUP has been developed to scale up crop productivity and efficiency using the proposed algorithms.
